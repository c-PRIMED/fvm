Description: This package provides MPI support for Python scripting in parallel
        environments. It is constructed on top of the MPI-1/MPI-2
        specification, but provides an object oriented interface which closely
        follows the MPI-2 C++ bindings.
        
        This module supports point-to-point (send, receive) and collective
        (broadcast, scatter, gather, reduction) communications of any
        *picklable* Python object.
        
        For objects exporting single-segment buffer interface (strings, NumPy
        arrays, etc.), blocking/nonbloking/persistent point-to-point,
        collective and one-sided (put, get, accumulate) communications are
        fully supported, as well as parallel I/O (blocking and nonbloking,
        collective and noncollective read and write operations using explicit
        file offsets, individual file pointers and shared file
        pointers).
        
        There is also full support for group and communicator (inter, intra,
        Cartesian and graph topologies) creation and management, as well as
        creating user-defined datatypes. Additionally, there is almost
        complete support for dynamic process creation and management (spawn,
        name publishing).
